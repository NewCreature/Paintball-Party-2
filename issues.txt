Paintball Party 2 Issues
------------------------

[X]Figure out why turning on optimizations (gcc -Ox) causes JoyNet calls to
   crash.

[X]The game stalls when T3F destroys its display. The game crashes when I
   comment out the line that destroys the display and let the cleanup code run.

[ ]Disable premultiplied alpha during preview creation.

[ ]Fix issue where player name is shown on wrong "screen" during gameplay. I
   think I removed a piece of code from the player setup screen which was
   needed to prevent this issue from occurring.

[ ]Animation flags need to be cleared.

   [ ]Temporarily make animation flags cleared on load and re-save assets.

      [ ]Make sure to disable premultiplied alpha so we don't lose color data.

[ ]Font needs transparency conversion.

[ ]Dynamically allocate tile animation data so we don't have to have a hard
   limit. This will allow better compatibility with some legacy levels.

[ ]Blank screen when starting in full screen mode.

[ ]Crash on certain legacy characters.

[ ]Player Setup screen doesn't accept player input after creating new profile.

[ ]Pressing enter should accept entered name on new profile entry screen.

[ ]Game crashes on selecting certain characters. I believe there are issues
   with loading some characters.

[ ]Game froze computer when caching character data at startup.

[ ]Menu text not updated when increasing the time death match time limit.

[ ]The game crashes after selecting Netplay->Join Game option when no public
   servers are currently open.

[ ]Add option to configure server port.

   [ ]Port number needs to be stored in server list.

[ ]User reports graphics data lost when changing resolution.

[ ]User reports issues on player setup screen.

[ ]Add icon to indicate if a player is currently holding coins in Coin Rush
   mode.

[ ]Add indicators for where coins are located in Coin Rush mode.

[ ]Finish in-game HUD.

[ ]Fix music loops. They were configured while Allegro had a looping bug and
   need to be reconfigured.

[ ]Finish making levels.
