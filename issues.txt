Paintball Party 2 Issues
------------------------

[X]Figure out why turning on optimizations (gcc -Ox) causes JoyNet calls to
   crash.

   comment out the line that destroys the display and let the cleanup code run.

[ ]Animation flags need to be cleared.

[ ]Font needs transparency conversion.

[ ]Dynamically allocate tile animation data so we don't have to have a hard

   with loading some characters.

   servers are currently open.

   need to be reconfigured.

[ ]Finish making levels.
