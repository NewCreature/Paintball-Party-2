Paintball Party 2 Issues
------------------------

[X]Figure out why turning on optimizations (gcc -Ox) causes JoyNet calls to
   crash.

[X]The game stalls when T3F destroys its display. The game crashes when I
   comment out the line that destroys the display and let the cleanup code run.

[X]Font needs transparency conversion.

[X]Crash on certain legacy characters.

[X]Game crashes on selecting certain characters. I believe there are issues
   with loading some characters.

[X]Game froze computer when caching character data at startup.

[X]Fix music loops. They were configured while Allegro had a looping bug and
   need to be reconfigured.

[X]Disable premultiplied alpha during preview creation.

[X]Animation flags need to be cleared.

   [X]Temporarily make animation flags cleared on load and re-save assets.

      [X]Make sure to disable premultiplied alpha so we don't lose color data.

[ ]Use 960x540 virtual display size so we can utilize full 1080p for split screen.

   [ ]Use T3F's fill screen option and position HUD elements dynamically so we
      get nice views on any screen size.

      [ ]Fix any issues with fill screen with the view system. Not sure if it
         will work as currently implemented.

   [ ]Pick suitable window size depending on desktop resolution. Make 540 the
      smallest vertical size and 1080 the largest. Pick 810 if desktop is <=
      1080. Use 720x810 unless vertical size is <= 810.

[ ]Highlight all in-game projectiles. It is currently difficult to see
   paintballs if the background matches the color of the paintball.

   [ ]Render a highlighter before rendering the paintball. Highlighter should
      be scaled to be slightly larger than the paintball. This will need to be
      determined at run time.

[ ]Determine placement of ammo icons based on character graphics instead of hit
   box. Many legacy characters have hit boxes defined in such a way that the
   icons overlap the character graphics.

[ ]Look into T3F joystick implementation. I think the maximum number of
   buttons, sticks, etc. need to be increased. When trying to play multiplayer
   with two Wii U Pro Controllers hooked up to a Mayflash adapter, only the
   first player's buttons were able to be mapped to their controller. It seems
   to be a software limit but I will have to test it using Enjoyable and
   Allegro's ex_joystick_events to find out for sure.

[ ]Fix issue where player name is shown on wrong "screen" during gameplay.

[ ]Dynamically allocate tile animation data so we don't have to have a hard
   limit. This will allow better compatibility with some legacy levels.

[ ]Blank screen when starting in full screen mode.

[ ]Player Setup screen doesn't accept player input after creating new profile.

[ ]Pressing enter should accept entered name on new profile entry screen.

[ ]Menu text not updated when increasing the time death match time limit.

[ ]The game crashes after selecting Netplay->Join Game option when no public
   servers are currently open.

[ ]Add option to configure server port.

   [ ]Port number needs to be stored in server list.

[ ]User reports graphics data lost when changing resolution.

[ ]User reports issues on player setup screen.

[ ]Add icon to indicate if a player is currently holding coins in Coin Rush
   mode.

[ ]Add indicators for where coins are located in Coin Rush mode.

[ ]Finish in-game HUD.

[ ]Finish making levels.
